# Paymug

A self-hosted platform for selling digital products where **merchants connect their own payment gateway**. Payments go straight to the seller. PayPal ships first; more providers can plug into the same architecture.

Built with OpenNext (Next.js 16), Tailwind CSS, **Cloudflare D1** (SQLite) with  **Drizzle ORM**

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/hieunc229/paymug)

## Features

- **Sell your way** — storefront, hosted checkout, one-time products, and subscriptions
- **Get paid directly** — connect PayPal or Stripe with sandbox and live modes
- **Deliver automatically** — files, license keys, and private GitHub access
- **Grow sales** — discounts, email campaigns, and affiliates
- **Run everything in one place** — customers, orders, refunds, analytics, and a buyer portal
- **Own your stack** — self-host on Cloudflare and extend with API keys

## Quick start

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env.local   # optional — defaults work for local dev

# Apply D1 schema to the local Miniflare SQLite file
npm run db:migrate:local

npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Database commands

| Script | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `npm run db:generate` | Generate SQL migrations from `src/db/schema.ts` |
| `npm run db:migrate:local` | Apply migrations to local D1 |
| `npm run db:migrate:remote` | Apply migrations to remote D1 (needs real `database_id`) |

Schema: `src/db/schema.ts` · Client: `src/db/index.ts` · Queries: `src/lib/db.ts`

## Configure payments (seller)

Payment credentials are read from environment variables and are **never saved
to the database**. The dashboard is used only to choose which provider
customers see at checkout.

1. Create a PayPal app at [developer.paypal.com](https://developer.paypal.com)
   (or a Stripe account at [dashboard.stripe.com](https://dashboard.stripe.com)).
2. Set the provider credentials as environment variables on the deployment
   (see the Environment table below for the exact names; one set for sandbox
   and one for live).
3. In Paymug: **Dashboard → Payments** → choose the active provider and click
   **Set up webhook automatically** for sandbox/live (creates the PayPal
   webhook pointing at the app; requires a public HTTPS app URL). For Stripe,
   create the webhook endpoint in the Stripe dashboard and set
   `STRIPE_*_WEBHOOK_SECRET`.
4. Publish a product and open its checkout link.

Use [sandbox buyer accounts](https://developer.paypal.com/dashboard/accounts)
or Stripe test keys to test purchases.

## Seller flow

1. Sign up → store created  
2. Connect PayPal  
3. Create & publish products  
4. Share `/buy/{id}` or the storefront homepage `/`  
5. Buyer pays **your** PayPal → order marked paid → delivery content shown  

## API surface (high level)

| Method | Path | Purpose |
|--------|------|---------|
| POST | `/api/auth/signup` | Create merchant |
| POST | `/api/auth/login` | Session login |
| GET/POST | `/api/products` | List / create products |
| GET | `/api/payments/paypal/connect` | PayPal credential status (from env) |
| POST | `/api/payments/paypal/create-order` | Create PayPal order (buyer) |
| POST | `/api/payments/paypal/capture-order` | Capture payment |

## Environment

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AUTH_SECRET` | JWT session signing key |
| `ENCRYPTION_SECRET` | Encrypts integration secrets at rest |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` | Absolute origin for PayPal/Stripe return and webhook URLs |
| `PAYPAL_SANDBOX_CLIENT_ID` | PayPal sandbox app Client ID |
| `PAYPAL_SANDBOX_CLIENT_SECRET` | PayPal sandbox app Client Secret |
| `PAYPAL_LIVE_CLIENT_ID` | PayPal live app Client ID |
| `PAYPAL_LIVE_CLIENT_SECRET` | PayPal live app Client Secret |
| `STRIPE_SANDBOX_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe test secret key (`sk_test_…`) |
| `STRIPE_SANDBOX_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe test webhook signing secret (`whsec_…`) |
| `STRIPE_LIVE_SECRET_KEY` | Stripe live secret key (`sk_live_…`) |
| `STRIPE_LIVE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | Stripe live webhook signing secret (`whsec_…`) |
| `EMAIL_FROM` | Verified Paymug sender on your Cloudflare Email Service domain |
| `EMAIL_REPLY_TO` | Optional customer reply address |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_ID` | GitHub OAuth App client ID |
| `GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET` | GitHub OAuth App client secret |

Set the GitHub OAuth App callback URL to
`<NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL>/api/github/oauth/callback`.

`AUTH_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` are required at
runtime: the app fails closed (session signing, secret decryption, and URL
construction refuse to run) instead of falling back to a default or to the
request `Host` header.

## Cloudflare Email Service

1. In Cloudflare, open **Compute → Email Service → Email Sending** and onboard the sending domain.
2. Use a Workers Paid plan when sending to arbitrary customer addresses.
3. Configure `EMAIL_FROM` with an address on the onboarded domain, plus optional `EMAIL_REPLY_TO`. Store addresses are used only for replies; merchant alerts go to the Paymug account email.
4. The `EMAIL` Worker binding is already declared in `wrangler.jsonc`.

## Deploy (Cloudflare)

Deploy Paymug to your Cloudflare account in one click:

[![Deploy to Cloudflare](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/button)](https://deploy.workers.cloudflare.com/?url=https://github.com/hieunc229/paymug)

The Cloudflare resources are intentionally not tied to the demo account. On the
first deployment, Wrangler provisions a D1 database and R2 bucket in the
deploying user's Cloudflare account. Each fork therefore has its own data and
product storage.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The deploy command applies pending D1 migrations before building and deploying
the Worker.

## Private UserGitRepo setup and automatic updates

Cloudflare's Deploy to Cloudflare button clones its source into a new repository
in the deploying user's GitHub account and connects that repository to Workers
Builds. The button source must be public, but the newly created `UserGitRepo`
can be private. If the deployment must start directly from the private
`hieunc/paymug` repository, use Cloudflare's authenticated repository import
instead of a public Deploy button.

The update source is hardcoded as `hieunc/paymug`; users do not configure the
source or destination repository name. `GITHUB_REPOSITORY` identifies
`UserGitRepo` automatically inside GitHub Actions.

1. Give the purchaser's GitHub account read access to the private
   `hieunc/paymug` repository.
2. In `UserGitRepo`, open **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions** and
   add one secret:

| Secret | Value |
|--------|-------|
| `UPSTREAM_TOKEN` | A GitHub credential belonging to that purchaser with Contents read access to `hieunc/paymug` |

3. Ensure GitHub Actions is enabled for `UserGitRepo`. The included workflow
   declares `contents: write`, so its repository-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN` can push
   the merged update back to `UserGitRepo` without another token.

After setup:

- `.github/workflows/sync-upstream.yml` checks `hieunc/paymug/latest` every six
  hours and can also be run manually. It safely merges new upstream commits and
  pushes `UserGitRepo/main`.
- That push triggers the Cloudflare Workers Build already connected during the
  one-click deployment. The sync workflow does not deploy a second time.
- `/api/deployments` exposes the current official Paymug version and release
  SHA. **Settings → About → Check for update** reads that endpoint, so no GitHub
  token is stored in the Worker runtime.
- Build metadata discovers `UserGitRepo` from the Git remote and uses
  Cloudflare's `WORKERS_CI_COMMIT_SHA`; no repository or commit environment
  variables are required.
- A merge conflict stops the update instead of overwriting user changes.
  Resolve it in `UserGitRepo`, then rerun **Sync upstream updates**.
- `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` remains an optional manual fallback. It needs
  `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID` and `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`, but normal Workers Builds
  deployments do not.

Keep runtime application secrets such as `AUTH_SECRET`, `ENCRYPTION_SECRET`, and
payment credentials in Cloudflare. Automated deployments preserve variables and
secrets already configured on the Worker.

## Roadmap ideas

- Stripe and Paddle as additional gateways
- Custom domains
